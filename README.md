Because life isn’t fragile enough!

This mod turns water into a force to be reckoned with. Torches get extinguished, grass uproots itself, crops burst into seeds and fruit. On the bright side, if you have a pipeworks sand tube, you can auto-harvest a lot of crops by flooding the field. If grass is annoying as f**k to clean up, a similar strategy can be used to uproot it all at once. And if you need a torch to stay lit underwater, there’s a simple recipe for a waterproof torch. It’s green because science. Also try throwing super glow glass (moreblocks) into a circular saw and prepare to be enlightened.

Griefers will rejoice at this mod. Be sure to learn how to use rollback if you install it on your server. Remember, a server without active admins is a server of stagnation and doom.

TODO: make lava burn entities because we’re f**king masochists and also having a lava trash can is cool.  ...maybe just a trash can object that burns entities, that looks like lava.
